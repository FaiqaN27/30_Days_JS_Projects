## 📚 What I Learned

- How to connect a frontend form to Google Sheets using Apps Script
- Using `fetch()` to send POST requests to a web app URL
- Validating user input using JavaScript
- Providing real-time user feedback after submission
- Creating a serverless solution with real-world use cases

---

## ▶️ How It Works

1. User enters their email into the input field.
2. On submit, a fetch request sends the email to the deployed Google Apps Script.
3. The Apps Script saves the data into a linked Google Sheet.
4. The user sees a confirmation message, and the form resets.
