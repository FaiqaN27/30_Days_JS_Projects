# 🎵 Project 10 – Music Player UI

This is the eleventh project in my **30 Days of JavaScript Projects** challenge.

A beautifully designed, minimalistic music player interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The UI replicates the basic structure and interaction of a real music player — perfect for beginners practicing layout, styling, and basic functionality.
