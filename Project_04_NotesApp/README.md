# 📝 Project 04 – Note-Taking App

This is the fifth project in my **30 Days of JavaScript Projects** challenge.

The Note-Taking App allows users to **create**, **edit**, and **delete** notes right in the browser — with automatic saving through `localStorage`. It features a clean interface with real-time saving and dynamic note creation.
