# 🔔 Project 09 – Toast Notification

This is the tenth project in my **30 Days of JavaScript Projects** challenge.

The **Toast Notification** app is a lightweight UI component that displays quick feedback messages (success, error, invalid) to users in response to certain actions. It's commonly used in forms, dashboards, or anywhere instant feedback is required.
