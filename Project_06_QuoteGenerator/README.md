# 🧠 Project 06 – Quote of the Day App

This is the seventh project in my **30 Days of JavaScript Projects** challenge.

The **Quote of the Day** app fetches an inspiring quote using a public API and displays it beautifully. It also allows users to generate new quotes and share them directly on Twitter with a single click.
