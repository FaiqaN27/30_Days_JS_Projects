# 🎉 Project 29 – Confetti Celebration App

This project is part of my **30 Days of JavaScript Projects** challenge.

To celebrate completing the full journey, I created a simple but joyful **Confetti Celebration App** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. With a click of a button, a colorful burst of confetti fills the screen — a small tribute to the big milestone of consistency and growth! 🥳
