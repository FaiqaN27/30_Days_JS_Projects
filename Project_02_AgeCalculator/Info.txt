split("T")[0] â€” What does it mean?
When you call toISOString() on a JavaScript Date object, it returns a string like this:

"2025-07-11T22:34:15.123Z"

This string has two parts:

"2025-07-11" â†’ the date
"22:34:15.123Z" â†’ the time in UTC

These parts are separated by the character 'T'

The split("T") breaks the string into an array using "T" as the separator:

"2025-07-11T22:34:15.123Z".split("T")
Result: ["2025-07-11", "22:34:15.123Z"]
ðŸ“Œ Now, what does [0] mean?
The [0] accesses the first item in the array, which is the date only.
