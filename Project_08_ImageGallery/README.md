# 🖼️ Project 08 – Gallery Slider

This is the ninth project in my **30 Days of JavaScript Projects** challenge.

The **Gallery Slider** allows users to scroll through a horizontal gallery of images using both the **mouse wheel** and **navigation buttons**. It's smooth, responsive, and perfect for displaying photo collections in a modern layout.
