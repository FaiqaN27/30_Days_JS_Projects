# 🚀 Project 15 – Form Validation

This is the sixteenth project in my **30 Days of JavaScript Projects** challenge.  
I created a **Form Validation** project using **HTML, CSS & JavaScript** to validate user inputs in real-time before submission.

## 📌 Overview

The project includes a user-friendly form that validates name, email, and phone fields with immediate visual feedback. It helps users correct errors as they type and ensures that only valid data is submitted.
